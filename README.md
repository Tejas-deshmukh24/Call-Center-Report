# Call-Center-Report
The task was to create a power BI dashboard for analyzing the call centre performance of a telecom client.
They needed transparency and insight into their call centre data. For example: overall customer satisfaction,
total number of calls answered and abandoned, speed of answer, length of calls, etc. Accordingly,
the dashboard was created reflecting all the relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics.
